      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Lafayette Organized Graduate Students (Lafayette OGS or LOGS) is a
        cross-departmental group dedicated to building graduate student
        communication and allowing graduate workers to support one another. Many
        sectors of UL Lafayette currently operate through informal or poorly
        documented rules with little transparency to the detriment of the
        graduate workers experience and livelihoods. Allowing graduate workers
        to share information and speak with a collective voice is an essential
        tool to make equitable and systemic changes in such an institution. As a
        non-university affiliated group, we provide a structure for graduate
        students to seek support from a larger community and form working groups
        to address topics which will improve accountability and working
        conditions within UL Lafayette.</p>
      <h2>Our Mailing List</h2>
      <p>Lafayette OGS currently uses listserv for graduate students and
        workers to communicate about events and concerns, share questions and
        advice, and communicate about current activities and initiatives. Stay
        updated by clicking on the "Get Involved" link below. If you would like
        to become more involved, you can reach our organizing team by sending
        an email to <a href="mailto:lafayetteogs@gmail.com">lafayetteogs@gmail.com</a></p>
